## Summary

### Key Findings

- Hybrid search combining BM25 keyword matching with semantic vector search is now the industry standard, achieving 87% relevant documents in top 10 results vs 62% for BM25 alone or 71% for semantic alone (2025 benchmarks)
- BM25 remains critical for exact term matching, specialized terminology, and rare terms outside embedding vocabulary, with faster processing (trains/searches quicker than semantic methods in medical document tests)
- Vector/semantic search excels at understanding conversational queries and user intent but requires document chunking for long content and fails on out-of-vocabulary terms
- Modern ranking algorithms prioritize E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust) and behavioral signals over pure keyword density, with AI-driven search evaluating meaning and context
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is the most common method for combining keyword and semantic results, though weighted linear combination can outperform RRF with proper tuning
- Search optimization in 2026 has shifted from keyword-focused to conversational intent-driven, with long-tail conversational phrases and FAQ formats increasing AI search citation likelihood
- Tokenization quality using HMM or CRF models combined with large-scale corpus-trained language models directly impacts all downstream search performance
- GitHub chose BM25 over pure vector search for 100+ billion documents due to computational efficiency, zero-shot capabilities, and handling diverse query types

### Recommendations

- Implement hybrid search architecture combining BM25 for keyword precision with semantic vector search for contextual understanding, not single-method approaches
- Use Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) as default fusion method, with weighted linear combination reserved for datasets where you can invest in tuning (typically 60% BM25 / 40% vector as starting point)
- Build robust tokenization pipeline using statistical methods (HMM/CRF) with language model training, handling proper nouns, synonyms, stemming, and stop word filtering
- Optimize for conversational queries and long-tail phrases rather than short keywords, structuring content in FAQ format to align with AI search patterns
- Implement document length normalization in BM25 while chunking long documents appropriately for vector embeddings to preserve context
- Add behavioral signal tracking (time on page, navigation patterns, return visits) to inform relevance ranking beyond pure text matching
- Create entity-based content optimization strategy leveraging knowledge graphs rather than exact keyword matching
- Use semantic indexing with LSI keywords and NLP to capture meaning relationships, especially for natural language queries

## Generated Tasks

### Implement hybrid search architecture combining BM25 and vector embeddings with RRF fusion

**Rationale:** Hybrid search achieves 87% relevant results vs 62-71% for single methods, providing both exact matching and semantic understanding
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** search, architecture, hybrid-search, performance

### Build tokenization pipeline using HMM/CRF models with proper noun recognition, stemming, and synonym handling

**Rationale:** Tokenization quality directly impacts all downstream search performance and is foundational for both keyword and semantic search
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** search, tokenization, nlp, foundation

### Add behavioral signal tracking (time-on-page, navigation, return visits) to relevance scoring algorithm

**Rationale:** Modern search algorithms use user interaction patterns to determine content quality beyond text matching, aligning with 2026 AI-driven ranking factors
**Priority:** 700
**Tags:** search, ranking, analytics, user-behavior

### Restructure searchable content into FAQ format with conversational long-tail keyword optimization

**Rationale:** FAQ formats align with LLM query patterns and increase citation likelihood in AI search, addressing the shift from keyword to conversational intent
**Priority:** 600
**Tags:** search, content, seo, conversational-ai

### Implement document chunking strategy for vector embeddings while maintaining BM25 full-document search

**Rationale:** Long documents must be chunked for embedding models but BM25 benefits from full-document context, requiring parallel processing strategies
**Priority:** 700
**Tags:** search, indexing, embeddings, optimization
