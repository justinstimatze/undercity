# Research: Document knowledge.json structure and usage patterns in ARCHITECTURE.md

_Generated by automated PM on 2026-01-19T07:46:56.554Z_

## Summary

### Key Findings

- ARCHITECTURE.md should be concise and focus on stable, high-level architecture that doesn't frequently change - revisit a couple times per year rather than syncing with every code change
- The primary purpose of ARCHITECTURE.md is to answer 'where's the thing that does X?' and 'what does the thing I'm looking at do?' - serving as a codemap that reduces onboarding time from 10x to 2x for contributors
- JSON schema documentation should include clear structure description, usage examples, validation rules, and be broken into logical modular units with references between schemas
- Modern knowledge base structures in 2026 require hierarchical organization with clear top-down approach, version control, content status tracking (draft/reviewed/published/deprecated), and robust search/tagging capabilities
- Documentation should specify tech stack, deployment infrastructure, security considerations, and coarse-grained module relationships without going into implementation details
- JSON schema documentation can be generated automatically into searchable websites using tools, and should include titles, descriptions, examples, and structural diagrams
- Best practices for JSON structure emphasize naming conventions, readable formatting, proper escaping, and effective data structuring for maintainability and interoperability

### Recommendations

- Create a dedicated 'Configuration & Data Structures' section in ARCHITECTURE.md that documents knowledge.json's purpose, top-level structure, and how it integrates with the system
- Include a table or hierarchical outline showing knowledge.json's schema structure with field names, data types, required vs optional fields, and brief descriptions
- Provide 2-3 concrete usage examples showing common scenarios (e.g., adding new knowledge entries, updating existing entries, querying the structure)
- Document the lifecycle and versioning approach for knowledge.json - how it's created, updated, validated, and how breaking changes are handled
- Add a 'Codemap' section linking where knowledge.json is read/written in the codebase (specific files/modules) to help developers locate relevant code quickly
- Consider generating automated JSON schema documentation from the actual schema file if one exists, keeping ARCHITECTURE.md focused on high-level integration patterns
- Include validation rules and constraints that knowledge.json must satisfy, referencing a formal JSON schema file if available

## Generated Tasks

### Add 'Configuration & Data Structures' section to ARCHITECTURE.md documenting knowledge.json structure, purpose, and integration points

**Rationale:** ARCHITECTURE.md's primary purpose is helping developers answer 'where is X?' and 'what does this do?' - documenting knowledge.json structure reduces onboarding time and prevents contributors from needing to reverse-engineer the configuration format
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** documentation, architecture, onboarding

### Create JSON schema file for knowledge.json with validation rules and generate automated documentation

**Rationale:** JSON schema provides formal validation, enables tooling integration, and can auto-generate searchable documentation - reducing manual sync burden and ensuring accuracy
**Priority:** 750
**Tags:** schema, validation, automation

### Document knowledge.json lifecycle including versioning strategy, update procedures, and backward compatibility approach

**Rationale:** Modern knowledge bases require clear content status tracking and version control - documenting the lifecycle prevents breaking changes and establishes clear ownership
**Priority:** 700
**Tags:** versioning, lifecycle, documentation

### Add codemap entries showing which modules read/write/query knowledge.json

**Rationale:** The core value of ARCHITECTURE.md is answering 'where do I change the code?' - explicit links to knowledge.json usage points save developers 5x time when making changes
**Priority:** 850
**Tags:** codemap, navigation, developer-experience
