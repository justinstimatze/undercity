# Research: Explore existing documentation structure and inventory all documentation files

_Generated by automated PM on 2026-01-19T07:40:12.774Z_

## Summary

### Key Findings

- Documentation should follow a clear progression structure: overview/landing page → quickstart guides → SDK usage guides → in-depth reference documentation for advanced users
- In 2026, 'docs-as-code' approach is standard: documentation uses same tools as development (version control, issue trackers, automated tests) enabling shared ownership between writers and developers
- Documentation audits should be systematic and ongoing: use cycle counting methods (frequent, systematic reviews of different documentation areas in rotation) rather than infrequent full audits
- Organizations expect documentation to be 'audit-ready by default' with consistent formatting, traceable updates, and structured content supporting long-term compliance
- ABC analysis for documentation inventory: classify docs by value/usage (A=high-value/frequently accessed, B=mid-tier, C=low-value) to prioritize maintenance efforts
- Nobody typically owns cross-cutting documentation (architecture overviews, shared libraries, operational procedures). Solution: assign Documentation DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each major system
- Modular content architecture with robust metadata schemas is now essential, not optional—enables AI-powered search, automated testing, and better discoverability
- Documentation changes should occur in same code change request as code itself to keep docs fresh and synchronized
- Developer experience research shows reducing cognitive load requires clear documentation with consistent patterns, logical navigation, and comprehensive searchability
- AI-enhanced documentation in 2026 includes machine-readable formats (OpenAPI 3.1) to support AI coding assistants and automated testing tools

### Recommendations

- Conduct documentation inventory using ABC classification: categorize all docs by usage/value (high/medium/low) to identify critical gaps and prioritize updates
- Implement cycle counting for documentation: audit different doc sections on rotation (weekly/monthly) rather than infrequent full audits to catch issues early
- Assign Documentation DRIs: designate one owner for each major system/component to eliminate orphaned cross-cutting documentation
- Audit documentation against progression structure: verify you have overview → quickstart → guides → reference for each major feature/system
- Establish 'docs-as-code' workflow: move all documentation into version control alongside code with automated testing for broken links, outdated code samples
- Create documentation inventory spreadsheet with metadata: file path, last updated, owner/DRI, classification (A/B/C), format, audience (end-user/developer/internal)
- Implement 'documentation in same PR' policy: require doc updates in the same pull request as code changes affecting functionality
- Audit for audit-readiness: ensure consistent formatting, version history tracking, and structured metadata across all documentation files
- Add searchability metrics: track time-to-find information, search success rates, and context switches to measure documentation effectiveness
- Convert API documentation to machine-readable formats (OpenAPI/Swagger) to support AI assistants and automated validation

## Generated Tasks

### Create comprehensive documentation inventory spreadsheet with metadata (file path, owner, last updated, ABC classification, audience type)

**Rationale:** Provides visibility into documentation assets and enables data-driven prioritization of updates. ABC classification identifies high-value docs requiring frequent maintenance vs low-value docs candidates for archival.
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** documentation, audit, inventory, metadata

### Assign Documentation DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each major system/component

**Rationale:** Research shows cross-cutting documentation (architecture, shared libraries, operations) typically has no owner and becomes outdated. Explicit ownership prevents orphaned documentation.
**Priority:** 850
**Tags:** documentation, ownership, governance

### Implement cycle counting documentation audit process (weekly/bi-weekly rotation through doc sections)

**Rationale:** Ongoing systematic reviews catch issues early with minimal disruption, versus infrequent full audits that are resource-intensive and allow problems to accumulate.
**Priority:** 750
**Tags:** documentation, audit, maintenance, process

### Audit documentation structure against recommended progression: overview → quickstart → guides → reference for each major feature

**Rationale:** 2026 best practice shows clear progression structure reduces developer cognitive load and improves time-to-value. Identifies structural gaps in current documentation.
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** documentation, structure, developer-experience

### Establish 'docs-as-code' policy: require documentation updates in same PR as code changes

**Rationale:** Industry standard practice ensures documentation stays synchronized with code. Research shows this prevents the most common cause of outdated documentation.
**Priority:** 900
**Tags:** documentation, policy, workflow, synchronization
