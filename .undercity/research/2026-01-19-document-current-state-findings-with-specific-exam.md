# Research: Document current state findings with specific examples and locations

_Generated by automated PM on 2026-01-19T08:47:07.179Z_

## Summary

### Key Findings

- Documentation should be maintained in the same commit/PR as code changes to keep it current and make it part of the definition of done - not an afterthought
- Multi-level documentation approach is most effective: meaningful variable/class/file names, inline comments explaining 'why', method/function API docs (docstrings/Javadoc), and README.md in root directory with project overview
- AI-powered documentation tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor) are now standard in 2026 for automating routine documentation tasks and generating tests
- Current state architecture documentation enables rapid identification of improvement opportunities and change impact analysis through gap analysis between current and desired end states
- Engineers lose 10-20+ hours weekly to scattered documentation and organizational friction - centralized, searchable knowledge management is critical
- Arc42 template and C4 model are industry standards for architecture documentation with extensive community support and real-world examples
- Documentation must include concrete examples and code snippets, kept up-to-date as codebase evolves, with both code and non-code scenarios to support different learning styles
- Technology Baseline documentation should capture current state of systems before implementing new solutions, with transition strategies showing timelines and key milestones

### Recommendations

- Implement documentation-as-code: require documentation updates in every PR/commit that changes functionality, making it part of code review process
- Create a Technology Baseline document that captures current state of all major systems, components, and their locations in the codebase with specific file paths and line references
- Adopt Arc42 or C4 model template for architecture documentation to provide standardized structure for current state analysis and future state planning
- Include 'why' comments inline in code explaining rationale for non-obvious decisions, architectural choices, or workarounds with references to tickets/discussions
- Maintain a root-level README.md with project structure map showing where different types of components live (e.g., 'API endpoints: /src/api/*, Database models: /src/models/*')
- Use AI documentation tools to generate initial drafts of function/method documentation, then have developers review and add context about business logic and edge cases
- Document findings with specific examples: 'Authentication flow (src/auth/login.js lines 45-120) uses JWT tokens with 24hr expiration' rather than 'system uses JWT authentication'
- Create architecture diagrams showing current state with specific service names, endpoints, and data flows - update these in same PR as architectural changes

## Generated Tasks

### Create Technology Baseline document capturing current state of all major systems with specific file paths, component locations, and architectural decisions

**Rationale:** Enables gap analysis, change impact assessment, and reduces time spent searching for scattered documentation (currently costing 10-20 hours/week per engineer)
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** documentation, architecture, current-state, knowledge-management

### Implement documentation-as-code policy requiring README updates and inline comments in every PR that changes functionality

**Rationale:** Keeps documentation fresh and synchronized with code changes, making it part of definition of done rather than afterthought
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** documentation, process, code-review, best-practices

### Adopt Arc42 or C4 model template for architecture documentation with current state diagrams showing specific service names, endpoints, and data flows

**Rationale:** Provides standardized, industry-recognized structure with extensive community support and examples, making architecture comprehensible to new team members
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** architecture, documentation, standardization, arc42, c4-model

### Integrate AI documentation tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or Cursor) to automate generation of function/method documentation drafts

**Rationale:** Reduces routine documentation burden while maintaining human oversight for business logic and context - aligns with 2026 industry standards
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** documentation, automation, ai-tools, productivity
