## Summary

### Key Findings

- Solo builders in 2026 ship faster than 10-person teams by leveraging AI systems, automation, and lean workflows while avoiding coordination overhead and slow decision-making processes
- AI-augmented development is the dominant paradigm in 2026, with ~90% of Claude Code itself written by Claude Code, but treating LLMs as pair programmers requiring clear direction and oversight rather than autonomous agents
- Planning-first workflows are critical: experienced developers create robust specs/plans before implementation, with iterative refinement of plans before executing, as emphasized by Claude Code's creator Boris Cherny
- Automation serves as a force multiplier for solo developers - testing, linting, deployments, and backups should never rely on manual effort once workflows are established
- Core architectural principles remain essential: Separation of Concerns (SoC) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) reduce complexity and make systems easier to develop, understand, and test independently
- Solo developers should choose strongly-typed languages and familiar technologies, focusing on frameworks with good IDE support and clean, readable architecture (e.g., C# with Entity Framework)
- Solo developers require more flexibility, self-awareness, and self-discipline as they handle tech, project, and product leadership responsibilities simultaneously

### Recommendations

- Implement AI-augmented workflows: Integrate LLM-based coding assistants (like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) as pair programmers with clear specs and human oversight, not as autonomous agents
- Adopt planning-first development: Create detailed specs and plans before implementation, iterate on plans until solid, then execute with confidence
- Automate repetitive tasks immediately: Set up CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, linting, and deployment workflows to preserve mental energy for problem-solving
- Apply architectural best practices strictly: Enforce Separation of Concerns and DRY principles to maintain codebase quality as a solo developer without team review
- Build repeatable systems: Create documented workflows for common tasks (deployments, testing, code reviews) to reduce friction and operate with team-level efficiency
- Choose technology stack wisely: Prefer strongly-typed languages and frameworks you know well with excellent IDE support to maximize solo productivity
- Leverage AI for velocity without sacrificing quality: Use AI to handle boilerplate, tests, and documentation while maintaining human judgment for architecture and business logic decisions

## Generated Tasks

### Integrate AI-powered coding assistant into development workflow with plan-first methodology

**Rationale:** Solo developers using AI pair programming with planning-first approach ship production-ready products faster than teams. Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) emphasizes 'a good plan is really important' and iterates on plans before execution.
**Priority:** 900
**Tags:** ai, productivity, workflow, planning

### Establish automated CI/CD pipeline with testing, linting, and deployment workflows

**Rationale:** Automation is a force multiplier for solo developers - repetitive tasks should never rely on manual effort. This preserves mental energy for problem-solving and feature development.
**Priority:** 850
**Tags:** automation, cicd, testing, deployment

### Refactor codebase to enforce Separation of Concerns and DRY principles

**Rationale:** Without team reviews, solo developers must strictly apply architectural best practices. SoC and DRY reduce complexity, making each component simpler to develop, understand, and test independently.
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** architecture, refactoring, best-practices, maintainability

### Document and systematize common development workflows (deployment, testing, code review checklists)

**Rationale:** Solo developers need repeatable systems that reduce friction and eliminate wasted effort, allowing one person to operate with the efficiency of a small team.
**Priority:** 750
**Tags:** documentation, workflow, systems, efficiency

### Evaluate and migrate to strongly-typed language/framework with superior IDE support

**Rationale:** Solo developers maximize productivity by choosing strongly-typed languages and familiar technologies with excellent IDE support. This reduces errors and accelerates development without team safety nets.
**Priority:** 700
**Tags:** technology-stack, typescript, tooling, developer-experience
