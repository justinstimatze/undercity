# Research: solo_1770285814331

_Generated by automated PM on 2026-02-05T10:04:28.736Z_

## Summary

### Key Findings

- The identifier 'solo_1770285814331' appears to be a concatenation of 'solo' with a Unix timestamp in milliseconds (1770285814331), which converts to February 5, 2026, 15:50:14 UTC
- No authoritative sources or technical documentation were found for this specific identifier through web search - it appears to be a generated placeholder rather than an established technical topic
- This pattern suggests an automated research system that generates timestamp-based task identifiers for tracking purposes
- For a TypeScript/Node.js/CLI project using pnpm, vitest, SQLite, and the Claude Agent SDK, meaningful research topics would include: CLI framework best practices, SQLite performance optimization, multi-agent orchestration patterns, or testing strategies for agent-based systems

### Recommendations

- Replace this placeholder identifier with a specific technical topic relevant to the project stack (e.g., 'SQLite vector search optimization', 'vitest test organization for CLI tools', or 'TypeScript strict mode migration')
- If this is a generated research task, clarify the actual technical topic or requirement that needs investigation
- Consider implementing semantic identifiers that combine timestamps with topic keywords for better traceability (e.g., 'research-sqlite-perf-1770285814331')
- Document the identifier naming convention used by the automated PM system to improve debugging and audit trails

## Generated Tasks

### Update research task generation in src/automated-pm.ts to include semantic topic prefixes in identifiers

**Rationale:** Identifiers like 'research-sqlite-perf-1770285814331' are more debuggable than opaque 'solo_1770285814331' values, improving system observability
**Priority:** 750
**Tags:** developer-experience, observability, automated-pm

### Add validation in src/automated-pm.ts to reject placeholder research topics and require valid technical subjects

**Rationale:** Prevents wasted API calls and ensures research tasks target actionable technical improvements rather than timestamp-based placeholders
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** validation, cost-optimization, automated-pm
