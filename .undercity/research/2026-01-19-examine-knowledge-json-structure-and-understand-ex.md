# Research: Examine knowledge.json structure and understand existing content organization

_Generated by automated PM on 2026-01-19T06:57:02.747Z_

## Summary

### Key Findings

- No knowledge.json file currently exists in the project - this is an opportunity to create structured knowledge documentation
- JSON Schema (2020-12 specification) is the industry standard for validating and documenting JSON structure, with 60M+ weekly downloads
- JSKOS (JSON for Knowledge Organization Systems) is a specialized format designed specifically for organizing knowledge bases with entities, relationships, and hierarchical structures
- JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data) is the most widely adopted format for knowledge graphs, balancing human readability and machine processability
- JSONKnowledgeBase implementations typically convert structured content into vector embeddings for AI/LLM integration, organizing documents, classification classes, and relationships
- Best practices emphasize descriptive keys (snake_case or camelCase), grouped related data, double-quoted key-value pairs, and validation via JSON Schema
- For LLM/AI projects like Undercity (multi-agent orchestrator), JSON knowledge bases enable structured data integration while maintaining human readability

### Recommendations

- Create a knowledge.json file at project root to document agent capabilities, workflows, and system knowledge in a machine-readable format
- Implement JSON Schema validation for knowledge.json to ensure consistency and catch errors early (create knowledge.schema.json)
- Structure knowledge.json with top-level sections: agents (capabilities/roles), workflows (multi-agent orchestration patterns), concepts (domain knowledge), and metadata
- Use camelCase for keys consistently (aligns with existing TypeScript codebase conventions)
- Consider JSKOS format if building hierarchical knowledge relationships, or JSON-LD if integrating with external knowledge graphs
- Add npm scripts for knowledge.json validation and integrity checks in the build/CI pipeline
- Document the knowledge.json schema in ARCHITECTURE.md to guide future contributors

## Generated Tasks

### Create knowledge.json with agent capabilities, workflows, and system concepts

**Rationale:** Provides machine-readable documentation for the multi-agent orchestrator, enabling dynamic discovery of agent capabilities and better LLM integration
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** documentation, knowledge-base, ai-integration

### Implement JSON Schema validation for knowledge.json structure

**Rationale:** Ensures knowledge base consistency, prevents errors, and provides IDE autocomplete support for knowledge.json editing
**Priority:** 750
**Tags:** validation, schema, developer-experience

### Add knowledge.json validation to CI/CD pipeline and pre-commit hooks

**Rationale:** Catches knowledge base errors before deployment, maintaining data integrity across team contributions
**Priority:** 700
**Tags:** ci-cd, automation, quality-assurance

### Document knowledge.json structure and usage patterns in ARCHITECTURE.md

**Rationale:** Guides contributors on how to extend the knowledge base and maintains consistency with the multi-agent architecture
**Priority:** 650
**Tags:** documentation, architecture, onboarding
