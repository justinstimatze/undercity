# Research: Search for existing test files and understand current boundary condition test coverage

## Summary

### Key Findings

- Approximately 40% of production bugs are related to untested edge cases, making boundary testing critical for software quality
- Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) should systematically test values at, just below, and just above each boundary to maximize defect detection where errors most frequently occur
- Code coverage tools expose untested code paths, with relational operator coverage specifically designed to detect boundary test gaps and off-by-one errors
- Modern testing practices combine BVA with equivalence partitioning, extending beyond numeric inputs to character lengths, dates, enumerated lists, and API parameters
- Automated boundary tests integrated into CI/CD pipelines enable frequent execution and regression testing, with AI-powered tools increasing productive testing time by nearly 40%
- Branch coverage metrics help identify decision points that lack boundary condition testing, revealing missing test cases for different code paths
- Boundary testing should include both valid boundaries (min/max valid values) and invalid boundaries (values just outside valid ranges) to ensure proper error handling
- Modern frameworks (JUnit, pytest, TestNG) support data-driven boundary tests that scale easily, while API testing tools (Postman, REST-assured, Katalon) automate boundary parameter validation

### Recommendations

- Audit existing test suites to calculate boundary coverage metrics: number of boundary values tested divided by total boundary values identified across all input ranges
- Implement code coverage analysis with relational operator coverage enabled to identify untested boundary conditions in conditional statements (<, <=, >, >=)
- Create a boundary test inventory documenting all input constraints (numeric ranges, string lengths, date ranges, collection sizes, resource limits) and map existing tests to each boundary
- Automate boundary tests using data-driven test frameworks with parameterized test cases covering minimum-1, minimum, minimum+1, maximum-1, maximum, maximum+1 for each identified boundary
- Extend boundary testing beyond numeric values to include edge cases for strings (empty, single character, max length), collections (empty, single item, max size), null/undefined values, and special characters
- Integrate boundary test coverage gates into CI/CD pipelines, failing builds when critical boundaries lack test coverage or when branch coverage drops below defined thresholds
- Use visual coverage reports in IDEs to identify untested code paths, then analyze whether missing coverage represents boundary conditions that need explicit test cases
- Establish a boundary testing checklist for code reviews ensuring new features document input constraints and include corresponding boundary test cases before merge
