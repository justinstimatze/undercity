# Research: solo_1770373867863

## Summary

### Key Findings

- The topic identifier 'solo_1770373867863' does not match any recognized technical topic or standard. This appears to be an internal identifier or placeholder.
- For TypeScript Node.js CLI applications in 2026: Strict mode in tsconfig.json is essential for maximum type safety, and native ESM modules with experimental TypeScript stripping allows running TS files directly.
- CLI best practices include POSIX-compliant argument syntax, shebang (#!/usr/bin/env node) in entry files, bin field in package.json, structured output flags for parsing, and graceful error handling with clear messages.
- Vitest in 2026 is 10-20× faster than Jest on large test suites, reuses Vite's dev server for lighter footprint, and provides out-of-box ESM, TypeScript and JSX support powered by Oxc. Type testing is supported via expectTypeOf or assertType in *.test-d.ts files.
- For SQLite in Node.js: better-sqlite3 is the fastest library with synchronous API and simpler patterns. Critical optimizations include enabling WAL mode immediately after connection, wrapping bulk operations in transactions, using prepared statements, and proper indexing (can achieve 2000+ queries/sec with proper setup).
- Prepared statements in better-sqlite3 should be created once with database.prepare() and executed multiple times, which is significantly more efficient than constructing SQL strings for each operation.

### Recommendations

- Since 'solo_1770373867863' is not a recognized topic, clarify the intended research subject or replace with a valid technical topic identifier.
- Review tsconfig.json to ensure strict mode is enabled for maximum type safety.
- If using SQLite, migrate to better-sqlite3 library if not already using it, and ensure WAL mode is enabled on database connections.
- Add type testing to vitest configuration by creating *.test-d.ts files for critical type assertions.
- Review CLI entry points to ensure shebang and bin field in package.json are properly configured for executable commands.
- Audit SQLite query patterns to use prepared statements instead of string concatenation for better performance and security.

## Generated Tasks

### Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json if not already enabled

**Rationale:** Strict mode provides maximum type safety and catches potential runtime errors at compile time, which is considered essential for production TypeScript applications in 2026
**Priority:** 800
**Tags:** typescript, configuration, type-safety

### Add WAL mode pragma to SQLite database initialization code

**Rationale:** WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode significantly improves concurrency and is recommended to be enabled immediately after opening connections for better performance
**Priority:** 750
**Tags:** sqlite, performance, database

### Create *.test-d.ts type test files for critical TypeScript types in the codebase

**Rationale:** Vitest supports type testing via expectTypeOf/assertType, allowing verification that complex types work as intended at compile time, preventing type regression bugs
**Priority:** 700
**Tags:** vitest, testing, type-safety

### Refactor SQLite queries to use prepared statements via database.prepare() instead of string concatenation

**Rationale:** Prepared statements are significantly more efficient and secure than constructing SQL strings for each operation, and can achieve 2000+ queries/sec with proper indexing
**Priority:** 850
**Tags:** sqlite, performance, security

### Verify package.json contains proper 'bin' field and entry files have #!/usr/bin/env node shebang

**Rationale:** These are POSIX-compliant standards for CLI tools that ensure executables work correctly across different environments and meet user expectations
**Priority:** 700
**Tags:** cli, configuration, user-experience
