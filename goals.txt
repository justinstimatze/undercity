# Undercity dogfood goals - extracted from plan
# Run: undercity load goals.txt && undercity work

# Testing - more modules need coverage
Add vitest tests for the raid module - test the start, approvePlan, and extract methods
Add vitest tests for the cli module - test command parsing and options handling
Add vitest tests for the backlog module - test addGoal, getNextGoal, markComplete

# Features from plan that may be missing
Add a --dry-run flag to slingshot that shows the plan but doesn't execute
Add a "history" command to show completed raids from the stash
Add progress percentage to status command based on completed vs total tasks

# Bugs to fix
Fix streamAgentActivity in raid.ts - SDK message format differs from expected, not showing tool calls in streaming output

# Critical infrastructure
Improve merge queue to auto-resolve conflicts - that's the whole point of having a merge queue. Use strategies like -X theirs, auto-merge, or intelligent retry
