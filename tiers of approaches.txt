example problem

renderer doesn't render ellipses

mud tier: I could generate a bunch of images and have the model check it, token costly and not very effective
bronze tier: I could generate a bunch of test cases and reproduce until it works
silver tier: I could generate code that generates a bunch of test cases
gold tier: I could create a yaml dsl so that I can generate code that generates test cases more easily
diamond tier: i could create a js api for an embedded js interpreter that allows js scripts to generate the yaml dsl that can generate test cases
unobtanium tier: I could use the js api generator framework to generate a js api for an embedded js interpreter that allows js scripts to generate the yaml dsl that can generate test cases

the last one results in the least tokens to actually solve the original issue
